            <br>
            <h2 class="mb-3">The origins of Mardi Gras can be traced to medieval Europe, passing through Rome and
                Venice in the 17th and 18th centuries to the French House of the Bourbons. <br>From here, the
                traditional revelry of "Boeuf Gras," or fatted calf, followed France to her colonies.</h2>
            <p>
                On March 2, 1699, French-Canadian explorer Jean Baptiste Le Moyne Sieur de Bienville arrived at a
                plot of ground 60 miles directly south of New Orleans, and named it "Pointe du Mardi Gras" when his
                men realized it was the eve of the festive holiday. Bienville also established "Fort Louis de la
                Louisiane" (which is now Mobile) in 1702. In 1703, the tiny settlement of Fort Louis de la Mobile
                celebrated America's very first Mardi Gras.
            </p>
            <br><img src="images/IMG_11.jpg" class="img m-auto col-xs-4"><br><br>
            <p>
                In 1704, Mobile established a secret society (Masque de la Mobile), similar to those that form our
                current Mardi Gras krewes. It lasted until 1709. In 1710, the "Boeuf Gras Society" was formed and
                paraded from 1711 through 1861. The procession was held with a huge bull's head pushed along on
                wheels by 16 men. Later, Rex would parade with an actual bull, draped in white and signaling the
                coming Lenten meat fast. This occurred on Fat Tuesday.
            </p>
            <p>
                New Orleans was established in 1718 by Bienville. By the 1730s, Mardi Gras was celebrated openly in
                New Orleans, but not with the parades we know today. In the early 1740s, Louisiana's governor, the
                Marquis de Vaudreuil, established elegant society balls, which became the model for the New Orleans
                Mardi Gras balls of today.
            </p><br><img src="images/IMG_1111.jpg" class="img m-auto col-xs-4"><br><br>
            <p>
                The earliest reference to Mardi Gras "Carnival" appears in a 1781 report to the Spanish colonial
                governing body. That year, the Perseverance Benevolent & Mutual Aid Association was the first of
                hundreds of clubs and carnival organizations formed in New Orleans.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the late 1830s, New Orleans held street processions of maskers with carriages and horseback
                riders to celebrate Mardi Gras. Dazzling gaslight torches, or "flambeaux," lit the way for the
                krewe's members and lent each event an exciting air of romance and festivity. In 1856, six young
                Mobile natives formed the Mistick Krewe of Comus, invoking John Milton's hero Comus to represent
                their organization. Comus brought magic and mystery to New Orleans with dazzling floats (known as
                tableaux cars) and masked balls. Krewe members remained anonymous.
            </p>
            <br><img src="images/IMG_15.jpg" class="img m-auto col-xs-4"><br><br>
            <hr>
            <p>In 1870, Mardi Gras' second Krewe, the Twelfth Night Revelers, was formed. This is also the first
            recorded account of Mardi Gras "throws."</p>
            <br><img src="images/IMG_1.jpg" class="img m-auto col-xs-4"><br><br>
            <p>
                Newspapers began to announce Mardi Gras events in advance, and they even printed "Carnival Edition"
                lithographs of parades' fantastic float designs (after they rolled, of course - themes and floats were
                always carefully guarded before the procession). At first, these reproductions were small, and details
                could
                not be clearly seen. But beginning in 1886 with Proteus' parade "Visions of Other Worlds," these
                chromolithographs could be produced in full, saturated color, doing justice to the float and costume
                designs
                of Carlotta Bonnecase, Charles Briton and B.A. Wikstrom. Each of these designers' work was brought to
                life
                by talented Parisian paper-mache' artist Georges Soulie', who for 40 years was responsible for creating
                all
                of Carnival's floats and processional outfits.
            </p>
            <p>
                1872 was the year that a group of businessmen invented a King of Carnival, Rex, to preside over the
                first
                daytime parade. To honor the visiting Russian Grand Duke Alexis Romanoff, the businessmen introduced
                Romanoff's family colors of purple, green and gold as Carnival's official colors. Purple stands for
                justice;
                gold for power; and green for faith. This was also the Mardi Gras season that Carnival's improbable
                anthem,
                "If Ever I Cease to Love," was cemented, due in part to the Duke's fondness for the tune.
            </p><br><img src="images/IMG_111.jpg" class="img m-auto col-xs-4"><br><br>
            <p>
                The following year, floats began to be constructed entirely in New Orleans instead of France,
                culminating
                with Comus' magnificent "The Missing Links to Darwin's Origin of Species," in which exotic paper-mache'
                animal costumes served as the basis for Comus to mock both Darwin's theory and local officials,
                including
                Governor Henry Warmoth. In 1875, Governor Warmoth signed the "Mardi Gras Act," making Fat Tuesday a
                legal
                holiday in Louisiana, which it still is.</p>
            <p>
                Like Comus and the Twelfth Night Revelers, most Mardi Gras krewes today developed from private social
                clubs with restrictive membership policies. Since all of these parade organizations are completely
                funded by their members, New Orleanians call it the "Greatest Free Show on Earth!"</p> <br><img
