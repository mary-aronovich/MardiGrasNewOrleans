            <h2 class="mb-3"> Although many people around the world have heard of Mardi Gras, there are many questions
                that surround the event for people who do not live in New Orleans. Below is a list of the most
                frequently asked questions about Mardi Gras. Still have questions? Contact us and we'll be sure to
                answer you as soon as possible.</h2>
            <div class="faqs mb-3">
                <div class="qu mb-3 green">
                    Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?
                    <div class="an">No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone.
                        Do not believe the claims of businesses who offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an
                        "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official” is just a way for vendors to sell their
                        products or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are not licensed by
                        the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its
                        merchandise. In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras
                        celebration, but this is not true in New Orleans.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="qu mb-3 yellow">
                    When does Mardi Gras start and end?
                    <div class="an">
                        Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany).<br> Mardi
                        Gras day (Fat Tuesday), however, is on a different day each year.
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="qu mb-3 black">
                    Can I bring my kids to Mardi Gras?
                    <div class="an">By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family
                        celebration. Those of us who grew up in New Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up
                        and we continue going to every parade, because we used to use "taking the children" as our
                        excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of the stuff they will catch.
                        Throws often include toys, stuffed animals, beads and more.

                        The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size parades pass
                        anyway). We recommend seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon,
                        since parades can last until 11 p.m. near the end of the route. The Garden District portion of
                        St. Charles is a family area where you will see many families staking out their parade watching
                        position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the beautiful oak trees. You don't
                        have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                        You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in the suburban areas like
                        Metairie, which is only 10 minutes away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday
                        before Mardi Gras weekend, is the parade Disneyworld features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!

                <div class="qu mb-3 purple">
                    I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi Gras?
                    <div class="an">The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi
                        Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season,
                        roll down the streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all day Saturday and Sunday with
                        parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday are
                        also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday
                        night, and the Zulu Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the
                        French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

                    When and where do the Mardi Gras Indians parade?
                    <div class="an">The Mardi Gras Indians only parade on Mardi Gras day and on Super Sunday (generally
                        the Sunday closest to St. Joseph’s Day in March).

                        The Mardi Gras day routes are not published anywhere, but they happen in and around their inner
                        city neighborhoods. Some sources say that you will see the Creole Wild West tribe at the corner
                        of LaSalle and 2nd Streets sometime between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. after the Krewe of Zulu passes
                        by. Other tribes meet at the corner of Claiborne and Orleans following the Zulu parade.

                        The New Orleans Mardi Gras Indian Council always has their Indian Sunday on the third Sunday of
                        March, around St. Joseph's Day. Their festivities begin at Noon in A. L. Davis Park (at
                        Washington & LaSalle Streets) where the Mardi Gras Indians once again dress in their feathers
                        and suits, and take to the streets to meet other "gangs."

                        For the Indian Sunday parade route, visit our Super Sunday page.

                        Also, the Tambourine and Fan organizations traditionally hold thier "Super Sunday" parade on the
                        Sunday closest to St. Joseph's Day, with the event beginning at Bayou St. John. In recent years,
                        there has been yet a third Super Sunday called Big Sunday that falls in April during the open
                        weekend between French Quarter Festival and Jazz Fest. No specific details are available on
                        these events at this time.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="qu mb-3 yellow">
                    How can I find out what this year's Mardi Gras theme will be?
                    <div class="an">There is not a single official Mardi Gras theme since there is no single
                        organization in charge of Mardi Gras. Each parade krewe decides on its own theme each year,
                        which is often kept secret until the parade. Their costumes, floats, some of their throws, and
                        their "official" Mardi Gras poster (if they have one) reflect this theme. For example, after
                        9/11, patriotic themes were popular.

                        Most of the krewes are named after figures from Greek, Roman, and Egyptian mythology, but some
                        are named after the neighborhood where they parade.</div>
                </div>
                <div class="qu mb-3 green">
                    What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?
                    <div class="an">The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot.
                        Sometimes it will change from one extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to
                        layer your clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a warm afternoon.

                        Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get
                        somewhat dirty. Don’t forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then
                        you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!</div>

                <div class="qu mb-3 text-secondary">
                    Should we purchase seats for a Grandstand, like the parade reviewing stands on St. Charles Avenue?
                    How can I get tickets?
                    <div class="an">During Mardi Gras parades, seats aren’t a necessity. Most people at the parades will
                        be standing or even jumping for throws—and in between parades, people are walking around and
                        popping into local restaurants for a bite. However, we recommend Grandstands for people who may
                        have trouble standing or walking for longer than an hour at a time.

                        For Grandstand tickets, go to <a class="class" data-ga-featured="" data-ga-id="8949797"

                        can fall on any Sunday between March 23 and April 25. Mardi Gras day always takes place 47 days
